## Project Overview: 
This website allows the user to enter a word or phrase into a text box and click a button to load GIF images from Giphy. There is a paragraph containing the simple instructions for how to use the application. The application collects and displays the number of images requested by the user. Through the use of flex boxes, the application displays the returned images in a grid that scales with screen width and stays centered on the screen.
